# typescript_node_react_crud
A simple skeleton project in development for a CRUD application in NodeJS and using ReactJS


## Prerequisites

- npm install -g typescript ts-node

- MongoDB 3 installed.


Taking as a base information from:

https://itnext.io/building-restful-web-apis-with-node-js-express-mongodb-and-typescript-part-1-2-195bdaf129cf


- server (TS files)
- dist_server (compiled JS files)
- client_TS (TS files for React).
- client_JS (compiled JS files for React).
- dist_client (compiled React Bundle).
- scripts (SQL database creation and MongoDB scripts).



Next steps:

- complete tutorial from the web page.
- develop a NodeJS and SQLite version, in parallel, with adaptable DAO objects.
- develop client React using maybe React/Redux.



- Develop a TodoApp, starting from server. Using Sequelize and maybe Mongoose/MongoDB. No authentication, complete an entire CRUD line using server code and React/Redux.

- next steps: go with the frontend part, starting with showing the data. Then, work
simultaneously in the backend and the frontend so as to be adding all the CRUD functionality (ie, update, delete, create, etc).

Problems:
- query to get all Todos is not working, maybe is not pointing to the correct database definition file, or maybe instead there is some step needed to actually create the table. Maybe some population is needed?? SEEMS FIXED!
